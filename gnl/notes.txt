free double.
uniinitiized = 		buffer[readret] = '\0';
dont free stash at the end; 
i = -1;
	while (temp[++i] && temp[i] !='\n')
		len++;
		instead of ft_strlen so that it doesnt count the newline
		
		
when you free stash i have to set stash to nul otherwise it would be already freed and when the tester tries to free, it will say double free
